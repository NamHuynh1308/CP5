## _Data structures vs Abstract data types
## *Data structure
## +A specific way of organizing data and operations to access/use the data
## +Structure of the data tied directly to the implementation
## *Abstract data type: An implementation independent group of data and a set of operations on this data â€“ use a programming language to implement

## _Both arrays and ArrayList are data structures
## 	Implementation dependent
## Same characteristics: Duplicate elements, unordered lists, use index to access elements, null values
## Difference: array is static in size, ArrayList is dynamic in size, automatic resizing may slow down the performance, ArrayList can not have primitive data type, arrays can

## _Collection Interface
## Collection interface provides add(), remove(), contains(), Iterator: a mean of iterating over all objects in the collection
